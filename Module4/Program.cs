            // STEP 3a: Build an if/else structure (a conditional statement) that outputs a message indicating whether it is time to wake up or not

            // STEP 3b: Note that spacing with above lines is optional - it is formatting to make code easier to read

            // STEP 5: Equality operators (==, !=) can also be used in a conditional statement

            // STEP 6: There is sometimes an issue when comparing real numbers (add 0.1 to 0.2 and compare it to 0.3 - this will evaluation to false as the expression evaluates to 0.30000000000000004)

            // STEP 8c: Output what the user typed in

            // STEP 8d: Write a condition to compare a FULL CAPS version of your name to what was typed in

            // STEP 9: A code block of one or more statements is delimited using if (), and then{ and }

            // STEP 10a: Variables have scope - that is they may be only accessible within the code block within which they were created - create a local string variable

            // STEP 10b: Attempt to access the above local variable

            // STEP 11: There are more complicated logical operators (&, &&, |, ||, ^) - let's try the and (&) operator:﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
